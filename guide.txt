Move all the video files to your videos folder

After you move them, change the source(src) attribute to be what it is in the video folder

ex;
<video loop muted autoplay>
  <source src="./videos/production_id_5149124 (2160p).mp4" type="video/mp4"
    alt="bright and sunny">
</video>

JS side
The logic to check the weather condition(rain, cloud, sunny, etc)

Changing the video thats playing, based off of these conditions

ex;
if (rain){
    video.src = 'raining video'
}else if(cloud)
